                <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I first began coding when I was a freshman in high school and decided to take AP Computer Science Principles
                    to try it out, and I instantly fell in love. Since then, I took every computer science class that my
                    school had to offer, as well as working with Leetcode and other websites to try and improve my coding 
                    abilities. 
                    
                    I also attended my first hackathon around the beginning of my sophomore year of high school to try and work in a team on a single 
                    project for the first time. Our team, consisting completely of beginner coders with basic web design experience
                    in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a little bit of Python, made a website utilizing Python web scraping 
                    to display many aspects of Chicago crime in 2019 in a user-friendly layout, including a heatmap and 
                    a data table, organized by data types such as location, type of crime, and age of criminal.

                    While we didn't end up winning anything, we all gained a lot of valuable experience with the division of responsibilities
                    among our team and constant collaboration throughout the day, and ultimately finished our project on time and to the 
                    quality that we were hoping to.
                </p>
                <h2>The Next Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    After finishing my first computer science class and hackathon, I knew that this was something I wanted to do for the 
                    rest of my life. in the following years of high school, I took AP Computer Science A (Java), Mobile Application Development, 
                    and Independent Study Computer Science.

                    From there, I was blessed enough to be accepted into the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to continue 
                    my coding quest and pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Philosophy, where I have continued to 
                    take classes and program in Java and C++, as well as learn about the philosophical foundations and applications 
                    of computer science through studying the works of Alan Turing, Paul Churchland, and many other amazing philosophers 
                    as they theorized the true extent of how the human brain can be applied to computers and neural networks, as well as 
                    what the future holds for machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>What now?</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I am continuing to program daily, working on Leetcode and side projects (like the website you are on right now) 
                    to improve my programming abilities. In my free time, I also enjoy playing volleyball, both indoor and outdoor, 
                    playing guitar, working on cars, and hanging out with my friends. I can't wait for what the future has in store for me!
