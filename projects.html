                Throughout my coding career, I have worked on many side projects, some bigger than others, 
                to try and continously improve my abilities. This page is dedicated to showcasing them along
                with some explanation behind each one. This list is also continously expaning as I work on 
                various new projects, which I will post here.

                Created a dynamic web app from scratch using React.js for the front-end, Flask Python web framework 
                for the back-end, and Firebase for user authentication and database management. Worked collaboratively 
                as a team with GitHub, maintaining an organized workflow and helping overcome any merge conflicts as the 
                front-end and back-end teams worked at the same time.

                showcasing my projects and skills in a visually appealing manner while also ensuring mobile 
                responsiveness, allowing the website to seamlessly adapt to various devices. I managed project

                I developed a PG first-person shooter video game that I worked on throughout my senior year of 
                high school as the main componant of my Independent Study Computer Science class. I utilized 
                many different skills and programs, including 3D modeling and animation in Blender and C# 
                programming and game development in Unity. I learned how to 3D model and animate in a 3D 
                modeling software, program in a new language (C#), and utilize different parts of the Unity 
                software to make the game visually pleasing, including map and user interface design and 
                lighting, all without any previous experience.

                Along with major projects like the ones above, I have also worked on smaller projects as parts 
                of classes or hackathons that are not as well rounded or complete as my larger projects. Most 
                of these projects do not have a GitHub repository connceted to them, or if they do, it is 
                privated in GitHub classroom, thus inaccessible to the public. However, I felt that I should 
                include them here anyways, as they did help me improve myself.

                This project was created as a part of my first ever hackathon, utilizing the only programming

                through AP Computer Science Principles. Since I did not even know about GitHub at the time, our 
                group ended up saving the project locally on our school computers, thus redering it inaccessible 
                today. However, I definitely learned my lesson from that mistake and avidly use GitHub today. üòÖ

                This was the final project for my Intro to Computer Science I (Java) class in my freshman year 
                of college. While the majority of the app was already created for us, we were tasked with adding 
                a new functionality for the app from scratch. I decided to add the ability to input the user's 
                location on the map and have each attraction display its distance from the user's set location, 
                so that the user has a better idea of how far each attraction is relative to them.

                Throughout my Intro to Computer Science II class (C++), we were tasked with completing a new project 
                every week utilizing all the coding that we had learned up to that point in the class. With each 
                project we were given a detailed write-up with what functions we were expected to implement, how the 
                overall application should work, and we were sometimes also given test cases in order to see if our 
                code worked as intended before submitting it. For the projects that we were not given test cases for, 
                we were expected to come up with our own to test our projects locally before submitting to the final 
                autograder, which had a limited number of grading attempts for full credit.
